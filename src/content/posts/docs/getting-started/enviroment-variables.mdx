# Environment Variables

This guide provides a detailed overview of the environment variables required to run the SaaS Boilerplate. Properly configuring these variables is essential for features like authentication, database connections, payment processing, and more.

## Setting Up Environment Variables

The SaaS Boilerplate uses a `.env` file for local development. To get started:

1. Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

2. Edit the `.env` file with your specific configuration values

## Core Environment Variables

### Database Connection

```env
# PostgreSQL connection URL
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://docker:docker@localhost:5432/docker?schema=public"
NEXT_RUNTIME="nodejs"
```

Replace the username (`docker`), password (`docker`), host (`localhost`), port (`5432`), and database name (`docker`) with your specific configuration.

### Application Setup

```env
# Name of your application
IGNITER_APP_NAME="SaaS Boilerplate"

# URL where your app will be running
IGNITER_APP_URL=https://localhost:3000/

# Path where your API will be running
IGNITER_APP_BASE_PATH=/api/v1

# Secret key for JWT (Replace this with a random string)
IGNITER_APP_SECRET=your_random_secret_key

# Application environment (development, production, test)
NODE_ENV="development"
```

> **Security Note**: In production, always use a strong, unique `IGNITER_APP_SECRET` value. This key is used for signing JWTs and other security-related features.

### Authentication Providers

The SaaS Boilerplate supports various OAuth providers for authentication:

```env
# GitHub OAuth credentials
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret

# Google OAuth credentials
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
```

#### Setting Up OAuth Providers

**Google OAuth Setup**:
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Navigate to API & Services > Credentials
4. Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID
5. Add your application URL and callback URL (`http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google` for local development)
6. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret to your `.env` file

**GitHub OAuth Setup**:
1. Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
2. Click on "New OAuth App"
3. Fill in the application details
4. Set the callback URL to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github` for local development
5. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret to your `.env` file

### Storage Providers

For file storage capabilities, you need to configure your storage provider:

```env
STORAGE_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9000
STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
STORAGE_REGION=your_region
STORAGE_BUCKET=your_bucket_name
```

This configuration works with MinIO for local development, or with cloud providers like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or similar services in production.

### Billing Providers

For payment processing and subscription management, the SaaS Boilerplate uses Stripe:

```env
# Stripe private key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=

# Webhook secret for verifying webhook events
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=

# Public key for client-side Stripe integration
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
```

#### Setting Up Stripe

1. Create a [Stripe account](https://stripe.com/)
2. Get your API keys from the Stripe Dashboard
3. Set up your products and prices in the Stripe Dashboard
4. Create a webhook endpoint and get the webhook secret
5. For local testing, use the Stripe CLI to forward webhooks:

```bash
bun stripe:webhook
```

## Using Environment Variables in Your Code

The SaaS Boilerplate works with Igniter.js, which provides a type-safe way to access environment variables:

```typescript
// Example usage in your code
import { env } from '@/igniter'

// Access environment variables with type safety
const appUrl = env.IGNITER_APP_URL
const isDevelopment = env.NODE_ENV === 'development'
```

## Environment-Specific Variables

You might want different configurations for development, testing, and production environments. The SaaS Boilerplate supports multiple environment files:

- `.env.development` - Used in development mode
- `.env.test` - Used when running tests
- `.env.production` - Used in production

## Managing Environment Variables in Production

For production deployments, set your environment variables through your hosting provider's dashboard:

- **Vercel**: Set environment variables in your project settings
- **Netlify**: Configure environment variables in the Netlify dashboard
- **AWS/GCP/Azure**: Use their respective secrets management services

## Troubleshooting

### Environment Variables Not Loading

If your environment variables are not being loaded correctly:

1. Make sure your `.env` file is in the root directory
2. Check for syntax errors in your `.env` file
3. Restart your development server after making changes
4. Verify that there are no spaces around the `=` sign in your variable definitions

### Sensitive Information

Never commit your `.env` file to version control. Ensure it's included in your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information.
