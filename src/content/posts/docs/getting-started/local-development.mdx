# Local Development

This guide will walk you through setting up your local development environment for the SaaS Boilerplate. By the end of this guide, you'll have a fully functional development environment ready to build your next SaaS application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js 18+**: The SaaS Boilerplate requires Node.js version 18 or higher. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Bun or pnpm**: We recommend using Bun for faster package installation and better performance. [Install Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- **Docker**: Used for running local development services like PostgreSQL. [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- **Git**: For version control. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Installation Options

You have two options to set up the SaaS Boilerplate:

### Option 1: Using the CLI (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is using our CLI, which will guide you through the setup process:

```bash
npx saas-boilerplate create my-saas-app
```

Replace `my-saas-app` with your project name. The CLI will:

1. Create a new directory with your project name
2. Set up the boilerplate with all dependencies
3. Configure initial environment variables
4. Guide you through the remaining setup steps

Simply follow the CLI prompts to complete the installation.

### Option 2: Cloning the Repository

Alternatively, you can clone the repository directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/felipebarcelospro/saas-boilerplate
cd saas-boilerplate
```

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Once you've installed the SaaS Boilerplate using either method above, follow these steps to set up your development environment:

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

If you used the CLI method, dependencies are already installed. If you cloned the repository, install dependencies using Bun:

```bash
bun install
```

Alternatively, if you prefer using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

If you used the CLI method, basic environment variables are already configured. Otherwise, copy the example environment variables file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open the `.env` file in your favorite code editor and update the variables as needed. For more details, refer to the [Environment Variables](/docs/getting-started/enviroment-variables) guide.

### Step 3: Start the Development Database

The SaaS Boilerplate uses Docker to run a PostgreSQL database locally. Start the database with:

```bash
bun docker:up
```

This command will start a PostgreSQL instance with the configuration specified in your `.env` file.

### Step 4: Run Database Migrations

Next, apply the database migrations to set up your database schema:

```bash
bun db:migrate:dev
```

This command uses Prisma to apply all the necessary migrations to your development database.

### Step 5: Start the Development Server

Now you're ready to start the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

Your SaaS Boilerplate application should now be running at [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000).

## Working with the Database

### Exploring Your Database with Prisma Studio

Prisma Studio provides a visual interface to view and edit the data in your database. To open Prisma Studio:

```bash
bun db:studio
```

This will launch Prisma Studio in your browser, typically at [http://localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555).

### Creating New Migrations

When you make changes to your Prisma schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`), you'll need to create and apply new migrations:

```bash
bun db:migrate:dev --name describe_your_changes
```

Replace `describe_your_changes` with a brief description of the schema changes you've made.

## Working with Features

### Generating New Features

The SaaS Boilerplate uses Igniter.js for type-safe API development. To create a new feature:

1. First, define your feature's schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`
2. Run migrations to update your database:
   ```bash
   bun db:migrate:dev --name add_your_feature
   ```
3. Generate the feature using Igniter.js CLI:
   ```bash
   bun igniter generate feature
   ```
4. Select your feature from the available options

This will generate all necessary files for your feature, including:
- Types and interfaces
- Controllers with proper authentication
- Procedures with business logic
- API routes with organization-based tenancy

### Understanding the Feature Structure

Each feature follows a consistent structure:

```
src/features/your-feature/
├── controllers/         # API endpoints and request handling
├── procedures/          # Business logic and database operations
├── presentation/        # UI components
│   ├── components/      # React components
│   └── hooks/           # Custom React hooks
├── your-feature.interface.ts  # TypeScript interfaces
└── your-feature.router.ts     # API route registration
```

## Working with Authentication

The SaaS Boilerplate uses a role-based authentication system with organization-based multi-tenancy. To access authentication in your features:

```typescript
// In your controller
const auth = await context.auth.getSession({
  requirements: 'authenticated',
  roles: ['admin', 'owner', 'member']
})

// Access the current organization
const organizationId = auth.organization.id
```

## Setting Up Stripe Webhooks

For local development with Stripe payments, you'll need to set up webhook forwarding:

1. Install the Stripe CLI from [https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli)
2. Run the following command to forward Stripe webhooks to your local server:

```bash
bun stripe:webhook
```

This will forward Stripe webhook events to your local development server at `https://localhost:3000/api/billing/webhook`.

## Development Best Practices

### Code Structure

The SaaS Boilerplate follows a feature-based architecture, with code organized into the following directories:

- `src/saas-boilerplate/`: Core SaaS features (auth, billing, organizations)
- `src/app/`: Next.js app router pages organized by section
  - `(dashboard)/`: Protected application pages
  - `(marketing)/`: Public marketing pages
  - `(auth)/`: Authentication pages
- `src/content/`: Documentation, blog posts, and other content
- `src/core/`: Core components, providers, and utilities
- `src/features/`: Your application-specific features

### Organization-Based Multi-Tenancy

All features in the SaaS Boilerplate follow an organization-based multi-tenant architecture:

- Each entity is related to an organization, not individual users
- Users belong to organizations with specific roles
- API requests are scoped to the current organization
- Permissions are enforced based on user roles within organizations

### TypeScript and Type Safety

All code in the SaaS Boilerplate is written in TypeScript with strong typing. Igniter.js provides end-to-end type safety from your database schema to your API endpoints and React components.

### Testing

The SaaS Boilerplate uses Vitest for testing. You can run tests with:

```bash
bun test
```
