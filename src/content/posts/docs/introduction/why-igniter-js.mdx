# Why Igniter JS

At the heart of SaaS Boilerplate lies Igniter JS, a modern, type-safe HTTP framework designed specifically for building scalable TypeScript applications. This page explains why we chose Igniter JS as our foundation and how it benefits your development process.

## The Power of Type Safety

Igniter JS was built with one core principle in mind: **type safety without compromise**. This means:

- **End-to-end Type Safety**: From your API routes to your client code, everything is fully typed, catching potential errors before they reach production.
- **Type-Safe Routing**: Route parameters and query strings are fully typed, eliminating an entire category of runtime errors.
- **Automatic Type Inference**: The framework automatically infers types from your code, reducing the need for manual type declarations.

This comprehensive type safety translates to fewer bugs, more confident refactoring, and a significantly improved developer experience.

## Framework Agnostic Architecture

One of Igniter JS's greatest strengths is its flexibility:

- **Works with Any Node.js Framework**: Seamlessly integrates with Next.js, Express, Fastify, or any other Node.js framework.
- **Adapts to Your Project**: Whether you're building a small API or a large-scale application, Igniter JS scales with your needs.
- **Non-Intrusive Integration**: Add Igniter JS to existing projects without major refactoring.

This framework-agnostic approach means you're never locked into a specific ecosystem, giving you the freedom to choose the best tools for each project.

## Developer Experience First

Igniter JS prioritizes developer experience in every aspect of its design:

- **Minimal Boilerplate**: Get started quickly without sacrificing scalability or maintainability.
- **Intuitive API Design**: Clear, consistent APIs that follow TypeScript best practices.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed guides and examples to help you make the most of the framework.
- **Modern Development Patterns**: Built with contemporary development workflows in mind.

The result is a framework that feels natural to use, reducing cognitive load and allowing you to focus on building your application's unique features.

## Production-Ready Performance

Igniter JS isn't just a theoretical frameworkâ€”it's battle-tested in production environments:

- **Optimized for Performance**: Built with performance in mind from the ground up.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle everything from small applications to enterprise-scale systems.
- **Real-World Usage**: Being used in production by companies of all sizes.

## Key Features That Set Igniter JS Apart

### Powerful Middleware System

Igniter JS includes a flexible middleware system with full type inference, allowing you to:

- Create reusable middleware for common tasks
- Share context between middlewares and route handlers
- Apply middleware globally, to specific routes, or to groups of routes

### Context Sharing

The framework's context sharing mechanism allows you to:

- Pass data between middleware and route handlers
- Maintain type safety throughout the request lifecycle
- Build complex request processing pipelines without losing type information

### Built-in Error Handling

Igniter JS provides comprehensive error handling with:

- Type-safe error responses
- Centralized error handling
- Detailed error information for debugging

### Cookie Management

The framework includes built-in cookie handling with:

- Signing support for secure cookies
- Type-safe cookie access
- Easy cookie management APIs

## How Igniter JS Enhances SaaS Boilerplate

In the context of SaaS Boilerplate, Igniter JS provides:

1. **A Solid Foundation**: A reliable, type-safe foundation for all API routes and server-side logic.
2. **Seamless Client Integration**: Built-in support for React clients with automatic type generation.
3. **Scalable Architecture**: An architecture that grows with your application without requiring major refactoring.
4. **Developer Productivity**: Tools and patterns that accelerate development without sacrificing quality.

## Getting Started with Igniter JS

If you're using SaaS Boilerplate, you're already benefiting from Igniter JS! However, to make the most of it, we recommend:
